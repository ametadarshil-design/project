    <b> <big><big><big>N</big></big></big>ew Delhi is the capital of India, also serving as a district within the larger National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). It's the seat of the Indian government, hosting the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sansad Bhavan, and the Supreme Court. While often used interchangeably with Delhi, New Delhi specifically refers to the planned, British-built city that became the capital in 1931.
